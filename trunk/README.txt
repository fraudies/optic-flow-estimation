This directory contains Matlab (R) implementations of methods that estimate 
optic flow from image sequences.

I organized the implementations into folders named according to the authors
of the method. In alphabetical order, these folders are:
AdelsonBergen
Farnebaeck
FleetJepson
Heeger
HornSchunck
LucasKanade
MotaEtAl
Nagel
OtteNagel
ShizawaMase
UrasEtAl

Each folder contains at least the following two scripts (one is a function):
'DemoEstimateOpticFlow2D.m' and 'estiamteOpticFlow2D.m'. The first script
is the method that demonstrates the estimation of optic flow for a particular
method and the second script is the implementation of that method. The demo
script can be run by pressing F5. Note that several methods are compute intensive
and you have to wait 10-60sec for an output.

Please report problems, bugs, or suggestions to
florian.raudies__at__gmail__dot__com (Replace __at__ by @ and __dot__ by .).


If you use any of the methods or code, please cite the article on scholarpedia
