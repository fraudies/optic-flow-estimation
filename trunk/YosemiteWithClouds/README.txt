
The data was originally generated by Lynn Quam at SRI and David Heeger was the 
first to use it for optical flow experimentation. The sequence is generated by 
taking an aerial image of Yosemite valley and texture mapping it onto a depth 
map of the valley. A synthetic sequence is generated by flying through the valley.
